Various small utility scripts for my =$PATH= under the =bin= directory. Some of
them may be fairly reusable as is for others, whereas other scripts may be very
specific to my setup ðŸ‘‰ [[https://github.com/vyp/dots][vyp/dots]].

* hlwm-polybar

A script to show focused, occupied, free and urgent herbstluftwm tags in polybar
using lemonbar formatting tags. It assumes it is being used only in a single
monitor setup for now.

* hlwm-tag

A small =herbstclient= wrapper script for use with
[[http://www.herbstluftwm.org][herbstluftwm]].

It can be used to either switch to, or move the focused client to, the next
occupied or free tag.

Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
$ hlwm-tag <action> <tag>
#+END_SRC

Where =<action>= is either =use=, =move= or =both=, and =<tag>= is either
=free= or =occupied=.
